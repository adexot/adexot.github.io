                    I got excited about the mission and rolled my sleeves to
                    join the team at work. We released the first version of the
                    new application about 7 months later, for yakata sales
                    (black friday), this generated billions in revenue. The app
                    is still used in production today.

                    Humble beginning as a candidate of the first HNG internship
                    in 2016. This was a great experience that introduced me to
