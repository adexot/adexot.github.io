          <h4>Konga Online Shopping Ltd - 2018</h4>
          <p>
            Joined Konga as an Engineering Cadet, straight out of university.
            I was sold the mission to rebuild the customer facing web app
            <a class="underline" href="https://www.konga.com/" rel="noopener"
              target="_blank" aria-label="Konga">Konga</a>, with a focus on
            performance, responsiveness,
            accessibility, reduced cost of operation, and of course a better
            developer experience.
          </p>
          <p>I got excited about the mission and rolled my sleeves to join the
            team at work. We released the first version of the new application
            about 7 months later, for yakata sales (black friday).</p>
          <p>In this time, I got retained as a Software Engineer contributing to
            the engineering goals.</p>
