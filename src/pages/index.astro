      <p>I am Adekunle, mostly called Kunle (Koon-lay).</p>
      <p> I
        love the web with all my heart, being an introvert who likes to spend a
        good chunk of my time surfing the web.</p>
      <p>I work as a Software Engineer, specializing in Frontend technologies. I
        have an unwavering desire to build performant web
        applications at scale.</p>

          <h4>Konga Online Shopping Ltd.</h4>
          <p>
            Joined Konga as an Engineering Cadet, straight out of university.
            I was sold the mission to rebuild the customer facing web app
            <a class="underline" href="https://www.konga.com/" rel="noopener"
              target="_blank" aria-label="Konga">Konga</a>, with a focus on
            performance, responsiveness,
            accessibility, reduced cost of operation, and of course a better
            developer experience.
          </p>
          <p>I got excited about the mission and rolled my sleeves to join the
            team at work. We deployed the first release of the new application
            about 7 months later, for yakata sales.</p>
          <p>In this time, I got retained as a Software Engineer contributing to
            the engineering goals.</p>

          <h4>Hotels NG</h4>
          <p>
            Humble beginning as a candidate of the first HNG internship in 2016.
            This was a great experience that introduced me to the world of
            professional work setting.
          </p>
          <p>Fortunately, I finished as one of the few finalists with other
            awesome folks who are still my guyz till date. :smile:</p>
          <p>HNG was an eye opener and I'm a product of the internship who has
            moved on to make a decent career, just like many others.</p>
